# Annius of Viterbo â€” Antiquitates (1498)  
**Digital scholarship and editions**

This repository is dedicated to the works of **Annius of Viterbo (1437â€“1502)**, Dominican friar and forgerer, best known for his *Antiquitates* (Rome, 1498).  
It serves as a **scholarly hub** for digital resources, critical editions, and research tools relating to Annius and the reception of his writings.

At present, the repository hosts a first sub-project:

- **BnF Arsenal ms-5219 (RÃ©serve), ff. 1râ€“8r**  
  A Middle French translation (ca. 1510â€“1511) by **Robert Frescher** of portions of the *Antiquitates*, with digital edition and facsimiles.

Further sub-projects (critical editions, datasets, and digital tools) will be progressively added.
